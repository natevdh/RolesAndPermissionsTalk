## Protecting the Kingdom: An intro to permissions in SQL Server

## Abstract 
Have you ever wanted to give someone access to the database without giving away the keys to the kingdom?
Do developers "accidently" drop databases on you?
Can you answer the question who can see the data in this table?

We will cover:

    - What permissions there are and how to get more information about them
- What roles are and how to use them in order to make your security easier to manage
- How to figure out what permissions already exist on the database/server

- and much more
